**Electrum Doge** is a multi-address Dogecoin wallet that combines:

- A React frontend (`src/` folder)
- A Node.js backend (`src-back/` folder)
- Electron integration (`main/` folder and `electron.js`) for desktop environments

It supports wallets generated via BIP39/BIP32 (e.g., 12-word seed phrases), partial usage of Ledger hardware wallets, and custom Electrum servers for Dogecoin.
